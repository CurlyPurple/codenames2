## Why CODENAMES:

I used to play board games a lot when I was a kid. There was not one I probably had not played. Then as I got older, I stopped playing. During college, my love for board games got reignited, and it was due to playing this game with my friends. It is now my favorite board game and I wanted to share this game with as many people as possible.
