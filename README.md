2. The roles are at the top and you alternate by clicking the role title
3. Spymaster can see all the correct words, incorrect words, and the assassin word which, if guessed, will end the game
4. The spymaster comes up with a one word clue that links to a pre-determined number of words on the board and lets the guesser the clue and the number

## Why CODENAMES:

I used to play board games a lot when I was a kid. There was not one I probably had not played. Then as I got older, I stopped playing. During college, my love for board games got reignited, and it was due to playing this game with my friends. It is now my favorite board game and I wanted to share this game with as many people as possible.
