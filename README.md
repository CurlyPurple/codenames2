![Cards for Codenames in a 4 by 4 matrix ](./assets/images/Codenames.png)

## [PLAY](https://curlypurple.github.io/codenames2/) CODENAMES:

* You will need at least 2 players to play
* You are working as a team to guess all the correct words

1. One will be assigned the role of spymaster and the other will be the guesser
2. The roles are at the top and you alternate by clicking the role title
3. Spymaster can see all the correct words, incorrect words, and the assassin word which, if guessed, will end the game
4. The spymaster comes up with a one word clue that links to a pre-determined number of words on the board and lets the guesser know the clue and the number 
5. The guesser guesses by clicking on the board and if correct can continue guessing until their correct guesses equals the pre-determined number. If incorrect, the spymaster must give a new clue with new number of words to guess
6. Game ends if assassin card is guessed or if all the correct words are not guessed within 4 rounds

## Why CODENAMES:

I used to play board games a lot when I was a kid. There was not one I probably had not played. Then as I got older, I stopped playing. During college, my love for board games got reignited, and it was due to playing this game with my friends. It is now my favorite board game and I wanted to share this game with as many people as possible.
